> This tutorial provides a minimum working example (MWE) for an analysis scheme which may help you organize your code.

The calculator code (omnicalc) does two things: it runs calculations (one per simulation, saved to disk) and it plots results from many simulations. Typically plot scripts have a specific prefix i.e. `calc/plot-protein_rmsd.py` and are automatically detected by the factory and listed on the calculator page for the factory graphical user interface (GUI). These plot scripts can be converted into interactive notebooks in GUI and then executed directly, saving plots to a special folder and presenting them in the notebook and on the calculator page. All plot scripts can also be run from the command line by running commands like `make plot protein_rmsd`, as long as you have correctly prepared the metadata. This method always leaves the user in an interactive python session so they can inspect the data or develop more code. The user can run `replot()` in this session to re-execute the code during development. This is the standard method for analyzing results.

There is also an alternate, ***autoplot*** method which adds a few features. Plot scripts which use this scheme can contain a decorated function which only runs once, even if the user runs `replot()` many times to update their plots. This is useful when there is a lengthy loading process, in the case of very large calculation results, or if you would like to perform extensive post-post-processing (that's not a typo --- the calculations produce the "post-procesing" data). Every local variable in the loader function is exposed to globals so they do not need to be passed between functions.

An autoplot script can also contain specific decorated plot functions which can be plotted on the command line *without* an interactive terminal using commands like `make plot undulations undulation_spectra`, where the `undulation_spectra` function may be one of many plotting functions. This allows users to set default plot routines or call on specific plots which are not always run when the script is invoked. Since "plotting" is the only way that users can compare simulations, we have even relaxed the naming scheme so you can make a file called e.g. `compare_structures.py` which compares all of your simulations and then run specific functions with e.g. `make go compare_structures comparison_dev`. 

To demonstrate the autoplot scheme, create a plot script called `demonstrate_autoplot.py` with the following contents.

#!/usr/bin/env python

AUTOPLOT DEMONSTRATION

Setting `autoplot: True` in the metadata `director` or inside an individual plot will allow you to use a few
neat features which we call "autoplot" and make use of decorated functions to manage plotting.

Instructions:

1. Add the following entry to a specs file. Replaces `collections` and `calculation` with existing ones. 

plots:
  demo_autoplot:
    script: demonstrate_autoplot.py
    autoplot: True
    collections: cgmd_bilayers
    calculation: undulations

2. Run `make go demo_autoplot`. The omnicalc output tells you what has been executed.
3. Change the function. Run `replot()` to see that it changed.
4. Set `plotrun.routine = []` so nothing is plotted.
5. Use the `if __name__=='main':` block to develop new code in globals.
6. Exit and run `make go demo_autoplot plot2` to run one plot, non-interactively.

# The routine below tells us which plots to run. Note that None means everything, 
# ... [] means nothing, otherwise this list names the decorated plot functions to run, by default.
plotrun.routine = None

Then, add the following entry to your plots metadata. Ensure that you have a calculation called `undulations` by adding this to an existing demonstration. We recommend piggybacking this on the end of the [single pipeline walkthrough](/walkthrough).

{% highlight YAML %}

plots:
  demo_autoplot:
    script: demonstrate_autoplot.py
    autoplot: True
    collections: cgmd_bilayers
    calculation: undulations

{% endhighlight %}

Navigate to the omnicalc directory, typically at `factory/calc/project_name`. Note that `make go` is equivalent to `make plot`, to reflect the fact that "plot" scripts can be used for extensive analysis. We also set `script: demonstrate_autoplot.py` otherwise the code assumes the default name, which would be `plot-demo_autoplot.py` in this case. If you need to save data to disk, you should either use the `store` function at `omni.base.store` in your code or write a calculation, otherwise, you can use autoplot for extra analysis (this is why we allow `make go` as well as `make plot`).

Run `make go demo_autoplot`. The output is given in a screenshot below.

{% include figure.html src="../images/autoplot/demo_autoplot.png" %}

The instructions explain how the code is executed, but in short, this script runs the `load` function first, dumps all of its locals into globals, and then executes every function decorated with `@autoplot(plotrun)`. 

You can set `plotrun.routine = ['plot2']` to ensure that a generic call to `make go demo_autoplot` only runs that function, ignoring the `plot` function. You can also set `plotrun.routine = []` to run nothing, and use the standard `if __name__=='__main__':` conditional to develop code in the global namespace. You can always manipulate `plotrun.routine` on-the-fly. Lastly, 

The script provided above includes all of the features in the autoplot scheme, reviewed below.

1. A single function decorated with `@autoload(plotrun)` runs only once even if you repeatedly run `replot()` while developing your code. The load function runs before any global code if it is under a `if __name__=='__main__':` block. All locals are exposed to the global namespace so you don't have to pass them around.
2. Any functions decorated with `@autoplot(plotrun)` will run after loading. 
3. These plot functions can be plotted without the interactive python session using `make go plot_name function_name`. 
4. These functions are chosen by the `plotrun.routine` variable so that some non-standard plots can be ignored during normal execution and then selectively executed from the command line, or inside the interactive session.

You are welcome to set `director: {'autoplot':True}` in your metadata to ensure that all plots use this scheme, otherwise you can set `autoplot: True` in the metadata (see the example) above to use it on individual plots. The autoplot scheme was designed to eliminate conditionals and excessive control flow in existing plots developed by the authors. The use of decorators, the `plotrun.routine` variable, and the control over the load function is useful when developing sprawling, modular analysis and plotting routines.
